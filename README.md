# matrix | 42KL

This Specialization project aims to dive deep into the subject of Linear Algebra which powers most of the underlying algorithms in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics and other Computer Science subject matters. 
Topics and exercises included in the project:
1. Vector and Matrix operations (ie add, subtract, scale)
2. Linear combination
3. Linear interpolation
4. Dot Product
5. Norm
6. Cross Product
7. Trace
8. Matrix Multiplication
9. Matrix transpose
10. Row echelon form
11. Determinant of Matrix
12. Inverse of Matrix
13. Rank of Matrix

The objective of the project is to code the above operations without any help of libraries. The subject pdf is essential reading - over 60 pages long! - and introduces theoretical concepts to properties of Vector space and Linear Transformation (vector maps).
Also important is the 3Blue1Brown youtube video series - Essence of Linear Algebra. Both links as attached.

Project is coded in Python and the exercise imposed time and space complexity limit on each operations. Also implemented Python type system and generics (Python 3.6 and above). 

## To run MANDATORY exercises
Install Python version 3.12 for latest typing support
Clone github repo.
Run individual exercises using the following command:
```
python <exercise_no>.py
```
Results include test cases to verify that the codes work as expected. 

Project marks 100/100. Bonus not included.
